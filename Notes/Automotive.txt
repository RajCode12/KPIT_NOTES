# PowerTrain

T -> Torque
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
|			PowerTrain					|

			--------------------------------------------------

- PowerTrain -> Refers to the prime mover(Engine,Motor) and the driveline that transmits energy 
		to the wheels.	
- Diveline -> Includes all the components from prime mover to the wheels.
- Transmission -> Refers to one unit in the driveline, typically the primary gearbox.

# Requirements of an Automotive powertrain

- Transmit energy required for propelling the vehicle from the prime mover to the wheels.
- Should enable the vehicle to move from rest.
- Should adjust the torque and speed depending on the operating conditions.
- Should enable the realization of vehicle Specifications such as maximum acceleration, maximum 
	longitudinal speed, gradeability, fuel economy, range, etc.

# Ideal Prime Mover Characteristics

- Provides constant power over all speeds.
- Torque will be hyperbola ( Power(constant) / Omega )

Note:- At low speed, we require high torque (to break the inertia from rest to motion)
	As the speed increases, the torque requirement decreases.

# Acutal Engine Characteristics 

- The speed at which we get the maximum power (rated power)-> Omega P
- Maximum torque (rated torque) is achived at Omega T

# Advantages of IC(Internal combustion) Engine 

- High power-to-weight ratio
- High energy density of fuel used -> relatively compact energy storage.

# Limitations of IC Engine

- Cannot provide sufficient torque at near 0 speed -> Reuqire a "Move off" element such as clutch.
- Can Provide maximum power only at a certain speed -> it cannot meet the ideal traction hyperbola -> requires
	a multi-speed gearBox.
- Fuel consumption is strongly dependent on the operating point/state.

# Multispeed Gears

	Tin	-------->	GearBox	       --------> Tout
	Omega in					Omega out

- Torque and speed are inversely proportional (as Power is constant) 
- Output torque = input torque * gear ratio 
- Output speed = input speed / gear ratio	
- If we increase the torque by 4, speed decreases to one-fourth

# Automotive Chassis (A vehicle frame)

- the main supporting structure of a motor vehicle to which all other components are attached.
- Body on frame (1930) -> structural frame seperate from its body
- material used -> Carbon steel or Aluminium alloys (lightweight) 

# Types of chassis
 
- Ladder frame chassis
    -> oldest chassis and simplest in its structure like a ladder
    -> shaped like a ladder
    -> easy to  manufacure.  # made from steel ->  highly durable-> good shock absorver 
    -> ladder chassis is heavy and still used in vehicles carrying heavy loads 
    ->ADVANTAGES : 
        -> easier to assemble as parts can be easily put in 
        -> easier to fix as parts are not permanently attached 
    ->DISADVANTAGES :
        -> has weak torsional activity making it weak for cornering 
        -> heavy weight not makes it ideal for sports car or hatchbacks  
 
-> backbone chassis 
        -> constructs of rectangular cross-sectional tube connected to both  front and rear axle shape like a spine in a human 
        ADVANTAGES : 
            -> this constructions allows better connections of the axles to the ground enhancing the stability of the car 
            -> in offroading the  driveshaft is quiet safe even if  car hits the ground 
            -> higher rigidity and can withstand a lot of pressure 
        DISADVANTAGES :
            -> dificulty in repairing the drive train as entire backbone has to be opened up 
            ->costlier as manufacturing cost of this chasis is high
 
->  MONOCOQUE(a french term meaning single shell ) CHASSIS  : 
        ->also called structural skin . here loads are supported by an objects external skin in a manner similar to an egg shell 
        -> originally was used in boat . a true MONOCOQUE carries both  tensile and compressive forces within the skin 
        -> recognized by ABSENCE of load carrying internal frame.  
        -> overall constructions of car using this chasssis is very lightweight  and compact 
        -> modern suvs uses this chasis
 
        ADVANTAGES : 
            -> lightweight and compactness allows to be used in smallest of cars 
            -> handling qualities are greatly enhanced because the entire vehicle is one compact structure 
            -> manufacturing cost is quite low 
            -> safety of passenger and car is enhaced because of cage like structure
            -> being light ensures higher fuel efficiency 
        DISADVANTAGES : 
            -> lack of off roading capablities because of stiff constructions
            -> lack of agility bcz of no room of components 
            -> only affordable in case of mass production
-> TUBULAR CHASIS 
        ->  mainly used in sports car due to the safety it provides 
        -> upgrade of LADDER  chassis as it is 3 dimensional 
        ADVANTAGES
            -> better rigidity 
            -> offers best weeight/ rigidity ratio allwing car to be lightweight or strong 
            -> best choice for racecar due to light weight
        DISADVANTAGES
            ->compex structures and  cannot be made using autonomous methods
            ->time consuming to build and cannot be mass produced 
            -> not feasible to be used in passenger car 
            -> the structure raises the door which  makes it which makes it dificult to access the cabin
 
Different Types of Car Body Style :
 
1. SEDAN -> longest , 3 diff compartments  for engine , passengeers and cargo , 4 doors and closed roof 
        -> dont have high ground clearance -> spacious upto 4 5 people
        -> ex : nissan versa (subcompact sedan) , honda civic(compact sedan) , honda accord (mid size sedan) , dodge charger(full size sedan)
 
2. Station wagon 
        -> simialr to sedan having extended roofline and hatchbacks at the rear . 
        -> 2 box design  (middle row passenger and cargo space )
        -> also called state cars due to carrying a lot of passengeers along with a lot of cargo 
        -> station wagon(mazda 6 sportswagon)
3. SUV : 
        -> HAVING HIGH  ground clearance , bigger proportions , offroad capablities , 7-8 people
 
4. hatchbacks : 
        -> not big in size but can sets 4 5 people 
        -> traditionally a compact sedan . ex : minicopper  , audi a7
 
5. coupe : sporty , compact , 2 doors , fixed roofline 
        -> signature characterstics : longhood and sloping roof
        -> high performing cars 
        -> ford mustang 
6. sports car   : 
    porsche 911 , nissan gtr , ferrari 
7. convertible cars : runs with , without a roof , reduced baggage area . 
-> also called as cabriolets , roadsters  and spiders .

# AUTOSAR (Extension of Electroic Control Unit)

- AUTOSAR - Automotive Open System Architecture
- OEM - Original Equipment Manufacturer (that creates component that are used by another company for final product)
- VFB - Virtual Functional Bus (acts as a communication mechanism between different software components)
- API - Application programming interface

- Main Objective -> DeCouple the application software and the hardware

- Need of Autosar
	- A modern car has 20-100 ECUs
	- Each ECU serve as an application or task
	- Each Application software is tightly binded with a micro-controller or hardware control unit
	- So, If there are 100 applications been solved, there are atleast 100 ECUs
	- This make the architecture very complex 

- More Difficulties on ECU System for OEM
	- Software has to be written from scratch when hardware is changed
	- Whenever hardware is changed, OEM has to pay for Appication software as well as basic software (BSW)
		that comes with it.
	- When OEM want to add function to an existing ECU, it require a lot of effort
	
- Benefits of AUTOSAR 
	- OEM will pay for application software only
	- Hardware Abstraction - Developer can now focus on building the application than worrying about the 
		micro-controller because AUTOSAR provides Microcontroller abstraction layer (MCAL) that
		makes all the software independent of microcontroller
	- Standardization - Every supplier has to write software in a particular exchange format

# AUTOSAR Layered Architecture

- 3 layes of Autosar 
	- Application layer
	- Runtime environment
	- Basic software 
		- Service layer
		- ECU abstraction layer
		- Microcontroller abstraction layer
		- complex drivers
	- At the bottom, we have microcontroller

- Basic Software (BSW)
	- Divided into functional groups 
		- Service layer
			- Objective:- Provide basic services for application, RTE and software modules
			- Highest layer of basic software
			- It manages the OS, memory and communication services
			- Handles the diagnostic and I/O ports
		- ECU abstraction layer
			- Objective:- Make higher software layer independent of ECU hardware layout
			- It keeps the application layer independent of the ECU
			- It offers an API for access to devices regardless of their location
		- MicroController abstraction layer
			- Objective:- Make higher software layer independent of uC
			- Lowest software layer of BSW
			- It contains internal drivers with direct access to internal peripherals
		- Complex device drivers
			- Can be integrated into an AUTOSAR ECU
			- Used to access the feature of ECU not covered by BSW
			- Also used for migration purpose 

- Runtime Environment (RTE)
	- Objective:- Make AUTOSAR software components independent of a specific ECU
	- Autosar software component communicate with other component via RTE
	- Above RTE, the software architecture changes from "Layer" to "Component Style"

- Application Layer
	- Contains software components (SWCs) which realize the functionality of ECU
	- This is the piece of application that OEM is ready to pay

# Classic Architecture

- Application layer
- Data link layer
	- CAN STACK - segments the data into frames
	- CAN DRIVER - enable the access to hardware resources
- Hardware layer

# Design and Communication 

- Seat Heating Control
	- seven software components 
	- one power management, 2 actuators (left-right), 2 heating dial (to turn on heater), 2 Seat heating control
	- one Power management has 8 ports

- Atomic software component - smallest software component which will remain in one ECU only
- runnable entities - small piece of code to perform some specific tasks

#Autosar Adaptive

- C++ as a programming language
- Service oriented communication as a base for service oriented architecture (SOA)
- POSIX operating system (application run as processes)
- Client doesn't know where the server is located
- Applications connected at runtime
- Types of flexibility
	- static
	- client can take server subscription
	- client know the server location fully
